# Food Ordering App for SSN College eateries

A Flutter-Firebase project with which you can order food.This mobile application for Canteen food ordering was developed to shorten waiting time and to encourage e-payment to eliminate the use of cash. The current technique of ordering meals is standing in line to pay a token for the item we want. It is a time-consuming and exhausting procedure. The user is given an application in which he or she is presented with a list of all food products available in the canteen at that time, from which they may choose the food they prefer. Once the order is verified, the order information are posted in the order history listing page, along with a button that the waiter must press after delivering the dish.
